# Epitech HUB project 2021

This is the production version of [Plannifer](https://www.plannifer.herokuapp.com) the HUB project I made during my first year at EPITECH.

EPITECH let students realise an optional project by year called HUB project.
The students are invited to implement any idea until it's enough of a challenge.

Plannifer is a web application that allows you to schedule and organise the shores in your home.
You can register them and view them in a Calendar and in a comparison with other members of a home.

I implemented a rating system that compare the number of tasks of a member and their complexity.
You can also buy a premium version of the app, I handled the payments with the Stripe API.

I deployed the app on Heroku : [link](https://www.plannifer.herokuapp.com)

I also deployed it with Docker [here](http://51.77.137.170:8000/)

Unfortunately, the repo for this docker version has to remain private because it contains secrets.
